      <p class = "bio">My name is JazMinh Diep and I am from Seattle, Washington. I am a rising freshman at the University of Washington - Bothell majoring in Computer Science & Software Engineering. Computer science has been my interest for some time now as it is satisfying to solve problems with my own creativity. Being in a field that is male dominated has inspired me to build this website, We For Women, to expose others of the challenges women face in not only STEM but also in many other aspects in society. Kode With Klossy has given me the opportunity to meet wonderful individuals that have the same passion as i do for programming. In addition, i love to swim, travel, and be with family and friends. </p>

      <p class = "bio">Hello! I'm Saurabi Sakthivel, a junior at Foothill High School in Pleasanton, CA. In the past few years, I have been involved in a few clubs that are dedicated to supporting women in a designated field, such as Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS) and StemFemme. I truly appreciated the work that they did especially since it is trivial that all workspaces have women playing an equal role, and I found it a pleasure to be involved in that. My want to be further involved in women empowerment developed during my camp time at Kode With Klossy, where I was exposed more to the obstacles women face in respect to computer science and soon realized that the struggles do not stop there. So, along with assionate friends, I decided to create this website, We For Women, to encourage everyone to be involved in the women empowerment progress. Additionally, I love to bake, play badminton with my friends, and paint.</p>

    <p class = "bio">My name is Carryn Petersen and I am from Shoreline Washington. I am a rising junior at Shorewood High School. Computer Science has always interested me but I've always had a little fear of it. It just seemed so impossible, kind of like it was magic. But this year I've finally taken the steps to introduce me to code and I couldn't be happier. As a woman myself, I've always been a femenist and very involved with the femenist issues. But, from this, I have seen many ignorant people or people who are just very narrow minded due to where they live or have grown up. I want to expose people to the battles women fight around the world. While doing this I myself have learned so much and I hope that this will help create an educational and safe space to learn for people everywhere.

      <p class = "bio">Hi, my name is Alyssa. I am a student at Punahou School in Honolulu. Ever since I watched Project Mc2 on Netflix when I was 10, I had been interested in coding. I was interested in how people can build such complex software with such a foreign language. After getting older, Youtube rekindled my curiosity for coding. I had then enrolled to Kode with Klossy. Growing up, I learned about feminism at a young age. I beleive that women should get the same opportunities as men and that we need to educate more people about the struggles of being a woman and person of color. I dance ballet and enjoy theater and music in general.  </p>
