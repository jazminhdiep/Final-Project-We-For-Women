			<td><h3 class="name"> <center> Issue: </center> </h3> <p class="infos">  <br> Around the world, millions of girls cannot attend school. There are many reasons for these young women to miss school, whether it be money or gender norms. According to Unicef, "The reasons are many. Barriers to girls' education-like poverty, child marriage, and gender based violence-vary among countries and communities. Poor families often favour boys when investing in education." Forty-nine percent of countries have gener parity in primary eductation. Forty-two percent for lower secondary level-schools, and only 24% in upper-secondary levels, according to Unicef.</p> </td>

      <p class="infos">  <br> A major issue in the fight for gender equality is the gap of education between men and women. The core of this issue is the difference in how girls and boys are treated. According to USC Rossier School of Education, girls recieve less attention from teachers, hear more comments about their apperence than academic ability, and recieve less quality feedback than boys. At work, 50% of women in stem will eventually leave because of a hostile workplace. Gender bias will keep many women form advancing in their career. If there is one woman in a canadate pool there is statistically no chance she can get the job. And finally, men are promoted at 30% higher rates than women during their early career stages. </p>

Equity training for teachers may provide a way to bring more equality into the classroom. "There are aesthetic changes to accommodate women, as if women have a deficit," said Mary Andres, PsyD, Co-Lead of USC Rossier's Marriage and Family Therapy Program, and a professer in clinical education.</p> <br><p class = "infos2">Investing in young womens' education can help:
