			<td><h3 class="name"> <center> Issue: </center> </h3> <p class="infos">  <br>  Despite the shift in traditions and the rate of women pursuing higher education increasing, the gender gap in employment rate is present. Women only make up 49% of the global workforce, and while this may seem like a lot, men make up 75% of the global workforce. This is a difference of 26%, and this is just an average; some countries see a difference of 50% or more. And looking further into the leadership roles women pursue, it is evident that only few women become CEOs of large corporations. As of August 2020, only <b>13</b> women were CEOs in Fortune Global 500 companies.</p> <p class = "infos">     The discrimintiation echoes in the wages as well. In 2018 women earned 12.9% less than men in OECD countries. And this disproportion has not changed, and especially with the negative economic impacts of COVID-19, and disproportion only worsens. In formal jobs women only make 79% of what men make, and in jobs such as domestic work or as a street vendor the ratio decreases to 47%.  </p> </td>

The struggles women face in terms of employment can be addressed in several ways. Through government initiatives, investments by the workplaces, and advocacy even from the ground level. Age or gender should not limit oneâ€™s involvement in putting an end to this discrimination. Maintaining equality in employment is necessary to proceed bringing complete equality. Women are trivial for the economy and corporate world. By supporting women and assisting them in getting into leadership roles we can bring new perspectives and ensure that the business is better. Additionally, closing pay gaps will save the nation moany and consequently allowing investments in other important societal infrastructure.</p> <p>What can we do?</p>
